# QuIC_B
Matlab code for UA's quantum control experiment

SI_filtering_clean
This folder contains a rough set of code for simulating the behavior of 
UA's quantum control experiment with externally applied bias, microwave,
and radio-frequency magnetic fields.  This code differs from simulation 
code used in bgrape in that it does not use the rotating wave 
approximation for the rf-fields.  This gives the user the option to 
filter the rf-fields and see their effect on the behavior of the atoms.
Included in this code are a few .mat files that have measurements of the
transfer function of the X- and Y-control chains for the rf-fields.
